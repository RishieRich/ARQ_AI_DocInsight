Project: AI Document Summary Agent
Owner: Rishi
Context:
This file is a plain-text notes file used to test the ingestion and parsing
pipeline for the AI agent.

The content is intentionally simple, but contains multiple paragraphs,
bullet-like lines, and some dates for testing:

- 2025-01-01: Initial setup of the project.
- 2025-01-05: Added ingestion and parsing agents.
- 2025-01-10: Started working on summarization prompts.

Key goals:
1. Support multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, CSV, XLSX, TXT).
2. Normalize content into a common internal JSON structure.
3. Use LLMs to generate summaries, insights, and action items.
4. Keep the architecture modular and agentic for future scaling.

End of sample notes.
